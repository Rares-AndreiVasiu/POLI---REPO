## Lab 2: Introductory programs 

- [X] Write a function called swapLMD, which receives an unsigned number having exactly three digits and swaps the most significant digit with the least significant one, returning the result 
 

- [X] 2) Write a function with declaration void addTime(unsigned h, unsigned m,unsigned dMin); which receives a time-moment given in hours (h) and minutes (m) and prints the new time, adding dMin minutes to the current time 
 

- [X] 3) Median of three: Write a function that returns the median of three numbers (i.e.,the middle one, when ordering the numbers by value). Use conditional expressions and/or IF. Avoid long and complex code. Test your code for all possible orderings of the arguments (how many?) 
 

- [X] 4) Distinct values: Write a function that takes three integers, returns the number of distinct values among these (1, 2 or 3) and prints, depending on the case one of the messages, ”all arguments are equal / distinct”, or ”arguments 1 and 2 / 2 and 3 / 1 and 3 are equal”. Use as little duplicate code as possible, writing helper functions where useful. 
 

- [ ] 5) Bonus value: A local public transit ride in NYC is 2.75USD. You can load up your MetroCard with any multiple of 5 cents. If you load up with at least the value of two trips, you get a 5 percent bonus, rounded to a cent. Write a function that computes and returns the amount you need to load for N trips, and also prints the amount that will be left on the card. 
 

- [ ] 6) Rounding: Write a function called myround that takes a real number (double) and returns (also as double) the value rounded to the nearest integer, away from zero. You may use the standard functions floor and/or ceil (look up the man page in the terminal using the command man functionname). Write one more function that tests your implementation by comparing the result with that given by the standard function round. The function should take an argument x and print ”Test for x passed/failed”.
